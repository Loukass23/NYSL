        <p>FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</p>
        <h2>Sportmanship</h2>
        <p>
          The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
          youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
          coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
          detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
          technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
        </p>
        <h2>FIFA Field Regulations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>DIMENSIONS.</b> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
              within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
              dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
              and older.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b> Fields used within the competition program must
              be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
              participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
              field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
              Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
              field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
              dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
              associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
              required to play all their games away.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</b>

              <div class="fieldsul">
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
                    areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.
                  </li>
                  <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width. </li>
                  <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width. </li>
                  <li>
                    In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
                    dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.
                  </li>

                    The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
                    be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
                    bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
                    away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20)
                    both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field conditions require team benches to be on the same side of
                    the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two
                    (2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty
                    yards one (1) way from the halfway line.

                  <li>
                    The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to
                    locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required
                    to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
                    and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
                    the team they are supporting.

                    Except where it is determined by the referee to be
                    impractical, team bench areas shall be along the same
                    touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
                    outside the touchline, beginning not closer than five yards
                    from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
                    from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose
                    the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
                    remain within their team's bench area during the game

                    Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite
                    the team bench areas. Supporters of a team must assemble
                    on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that
                    team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yards on
                    each side of the midfield that may not be occupied by
                    parents or spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to
                    enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate
                    games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or
                    spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials
                    to comply with these standards.

              <b>SIZE OF AGE GROUP TEAMS.</b> In order to give player’s maximum

              modified rules and size of roster as stated in United States Youth Soccer
              Association (USYSA) rules. It is strongly recommended that U-6 and U-8
              play 4 v 4. UYSA shall not sanction games involving teams under 10 or
              younger unless such games are conducted with no

              Recreational/Developmental players at other ages or where numbers in

              Teams may make an unlimited number of substitutions at the times

              third caution (yellow card) during a playing year shall be confiscated by
              the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was
              received. That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in
              which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
              This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received
              during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
              next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending
              participate would otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall
